Code for the "Piecewise Linear Regression via a Difference of Convex Functions" is attached.

## Prerequisites:
MATLAB version > 2016
either of MATLAB optimization toolbox or gurobi integrated with MATLAB (much faster)

## Optional:
MATLAB Statistics and Machine learning Toolbox, Deep learning Toolbox these are needed for KNN, SVM and MLP results.
